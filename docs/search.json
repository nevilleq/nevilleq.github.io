    "text": "Hey y’all – I’m Q, nice to meet ya!\n I dabble in Biostatistics, Data Science, and Maths, and am currently a 4\\(^{\\text{th}}\\) year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota. Prior, I received a BA from St. Olaf College with Distinction in Mathematics in 2018 and an MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2020. My dissertation work revolves around fMRI brain imaging, hierarchical graphical models for multivariate time-series, and deep learning methods for ‘multiview’ data (brain imaging + “-omics”) with applications in mental health research – while my current day-to-day biostatistics work concerns interim analyses and conditional power in COVID-related clinical trials.\nWith the navbar above you can check out my resume and some current work, presentations, & publications. I’m an avid R user, passionate about data science, and would love to share my technical skills and biostatistics domain knowledge with an industry leader in the healthcare/data science field for an internship Summer ’23 | full-time position ’24.\n\n\n\n\nAbout me\n In my spare time you’re likely to catch me reading whatever new book by my favourite non-fiction author, Leonard Mlodinow, has recently published – or an older novel from the lesser known Stephen King, a relatively obscure author of mild fiction. I’m also a huge Lord of the Rings fan and have traveled all the way to New Zealand just to have a pint at the Green Dragon in Hobbiton. I love music and still slap some jazz bass & rock’n’roll guitar when the mood strikes. Though I’m getting older, I do still try to stay active and lift a weight or go for a jog when I can. Lastly, and probably most importantly, I am a firm, steadfast, unequivocal believer that hotdogs are sandwiches (sorry if that’s a problem). \n\n“If it was easy, everyone would do it.” - Dan Neville\n\n\n“…and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” - Gandalf"

    "text": "The University of Virginia’s Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative encompasses labs conducting research in all things biological, from genetics to public health policy. The Social and Decision Analytics (SDAD) lab, strategically located in the D.C. metro area, works “in partnership with communities, academia, government and industry” towards data driven innovations in public policy with “statistical rigor and the creative application of social and decision analytics”.\nWithin the SDAD Lab, The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) program run by Drs. Aaron Schroeder and Gizem Korkmaz offers a unique entrance into the complex world of policy and decision making for human beneficence. My role as a Graduate Fellow in the program has afforded me the opportunity to work in incredibly diverse teams, comprised of everything from Psychologists, Sociologists, and Economists to Healthcare Professionals, Computer Scientists and Statisticians, towards solutions to real world problems faced at the local and federal level. \n\n\n\n\nData Science for the Public Good Symposium\n\n\n\n As a part of my pursuit towards a career in Public Health, a project that I’ve been working on and will continue to work on for my practicum comes from Fairfax County, VA, just across the Potomac from The National Mall. With the county’s sponsorship, we are creating CommunityScapes which “lay a foundation for a quantitative understanding of human health, habitat and well-being”. More specifically, we have been developing an Obesogenic Environment composite index utilizing data from the American Community Survey (Census), Fairfax County, and alternative open sources to quantify and understand the geospatial Social Determinants of Health which contribute to environments conducive to the development of obesity. The ultimate purpose of this index is to generate a robust scale with which the county can assess the temporal effectiveness of their policy initiatives and interventions from a variety of geographic perspectives.\nThe experience has opened my eyes to a unique dimension of public health, in an environment budding with diverse fields of study, people, and ideas, which will influence my contributions to the fields of public health and biostatistics for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend this opportunity to anyone interested in new quantitative methods and applications for improving public health, living in the heart of public policy, Washington D.C."
