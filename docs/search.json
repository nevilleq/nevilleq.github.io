    "text": "Hey y’all – I’m Q, nice to meet ya!\n I dabble in Biostatistics, Data Science, and Maths, and am currently a 4\\(^{\\text{th}}\\) year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota. Prior, I received a BA from St. Olaf College with Distinction in Mathematics in 2018 and an MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2020. My dissertation work revolves around fMRI brain imaging, hierarchical graphical models for multivariate time-series, and deep learning methods for ‘multiview’ data (brain imaging + “-omics”) with applications in mental health research – while my current day-to-day biostatistics work concerns interim analyses and conditional power in COVID-related clinical trials.\n\n\nProfessional connections\nI’m an avid R user, passionate about data science for the public good, and would love to share my technical skills and biostatistics domain knowledge with an industry leader in the healthcare/data science field for an internship Summer ’23 | full-time position ’24.\n\n\n\n\nAbout me\n In my spare time you’re likely to catch me reading whatever new book my favourite non-fiction author, Leonard Mlodinow, has recently published or a classic from Stephen King. I’m also a huge Lord of the Rings fan and have traveled all the way to New Zealand just to have a pint at the Green Dragon in Hobbiton, among other less exciting things like skydiving (falling?) and scuba diving. I love music and still slap some jazz bass & rock’n’roll guitar when the mood strikes. Lastly, and probably most importantly, I am a firm, steadfast, unequivocal believer that hotdogs are sandwiches. \n\n“If it was easy, everyone would do it.” - Dan Neville\n\n\n“…and so do all who live to see such times.

It’s also a language that operates on tabular data, which in a not so technical way can be described as any data you can feasibly put into an Excel spreadsheet. Being procedural does make the language less flexible in many ways, but the trade-off in increased speed, efficiency, and ability to wrangle data without bringing it all into active memory is truly astounding – hence why it’s still around today!"

What is a derived table you ask? Similar to piping in R where f() %>% g(.) means takes the output of f() and passes it as an input to g(), when performing a series of wrangling functions like filter, mutate, *_join, etc. statement that pipeline is producing at least 1 derived table in the SQL translation.\nA derived table is a subquery in a FROM statement which produces an intermediate table and in most SQL versions must be named with AS. For example this is a simple derived table/subquery –\n\nSELECT * FROM (\n  SELECT var_1 + var_2 AS sum_1\n  FROM df\n) AS tbl_1\nWHERE sum_1 > 0\n\nNow why do need a subquery?

    "text": "1.3 Sub-queries\nVery similar in syntax and flavour to derived tables, sub-queries are just derived tables which only contain one column and are generally used within filter/WHERE/HAVING. For example, in R we can pass data manipulations, functions, and other variables within the filter without thinking anything much of it –\n\ndf %>%\n  filter(var1 < max(var2))\n\nHowever, SQL procedures/queries don’t operate like pipes and in order to mutate any variable AND have access to it in the same procedure simultaneously, we need sub-queries. The MySQL sub-query equivalent to the above is given by\n\nFROM df\nWHERE var < (SELECT MAX(var2) OVER() as max_var2 FROM df LIMIT 1)\n\nHere, the sub-query is itself a stand alone query but it must have only 1 column and generally will only contain a single value/character. Example use of sub-queries in WHERE/HAVING statements is found near the end of the examples in \\(\\S 3\\).\n\n#Sub-query is a valid query (1 col, 1 val)\nSELECT MAX(var2) OVER() as max_var2 #This is equiv. to mutate(max_var2 = max(var2))\nFROM df #df %>%\nLIMIT 1 #Only want first occurrence (it's a column of the same number)"

Here was my solution to the question “return the min and max length city name and it’s length. Return only the first alphabetical occurance if there are multiple.” This was the solution that worked –\n\nSELECT CITY, city_len\n  FROM (\n    SELECT\n      *,\n      MAX(city_len) OVER() AS max_len,\n      MIN(city_len) OVER() AS min_len\n    FROM (\n      SELECT *, length(CITY) AS city_len\n      FROM STATION\n    ) q01\n  ) q02 \nWHERE (city_len = max_len OR city_len = min_len)\nORDER BY city_len DESC, CITY ASC \nLIMIT 2 #Top 2\n\nHere you can’t just call max(len) or min(lin) directly in the filter/WHERE statement because they are two distinct procedures in SQL. Instead we need to use a WINDOW function via OVER() to obtain the aggregate max and min, have access to it later (mutate), without changing the current structure of the data (mutate vs. summarise).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nDerived tables are necessary to access new columns (mutate) or summary/WINDOW columns\nContinuously pass derived tables in ’reverse nesting-doll order nested fashion via SELECT\nGenerally I don’t like using arrange/ORDER BY to ensure ordering of things as it can break fairly easily if the data isn’t immaculately clean (I trust factor structure/ordinal undercoding more in general), but it seems to work here.\nNo user defined functions in SQL queries like mutate(new_var = my_func(old_var)), unfortunately"

Personally, I’ve been using it for years and have grown quite fond of it – which is why fear and grief struck me when I heard that Quarto, the R team’s new multi-language scientific communication tool, was going to be replacing Rmarkdown. Though I was excited for all the new possibilities I was also upset. In my old age, I’d grown quite fond of Rmarkdown and I stubbornly resented having to learn something new.\nGood news! It turns out I was being a wee bit dramatic given that Quarto is still fundamentally an R/Rstudio product, and as such, is very very similar in style and workflow to Rmarkdown – so luckily if you’re familiar with .rmd then transitioning to .qmd will be rather painless. If you’re new to both, have no fear! Rstudio (the IDE interface) makes it easy to use and with the use of .Rprojects (see below), most project come with example .qmd files to get you started.\nOne feature of knitr Rmarkdown that I’d always personally found to be really cool was the ability to render and host websites built with R & Rmarkdown on Github for free. I host(ed) my own website with Rmarkdown & Github so I was naturally curious how difficult or different it would be to switch it over to a Quarto website, and it turns out, not too hard at all. I thought it would useful to share some of that experience so that we all have a brief intro to some really important tools like .git, Github, and Quarto, but mostly, so that we can all share the wonderful work we do here for free with the world!

Connect a local .Rproject to a repository on Github\nNow that you’ve set up a repository on Github made a change to the repository by updating the .gitignore file, it’s time to connect our local folder with the remote one on a Github and push our changes up there. While it’s possible to do this via the Git GUI (accessed in the upper right pane next to Environment, History, Build, etc.), I’d highly recommend following these instructions in the built-in terminal (these are also more or less given on Github after you initialized the empty repository).\nTo do so –\n\nSwitch to ‘Terminal’\n\nLower left pane, next to ‘Console’\n\nType in the following –\n\ngit add .gitignore or git add * (all files)\ngit commit -m \"Adding data folder to .gitignore\"\ngit pull origin main (This will fail, why?)\n\nEven though this won’t do anything, it’s good practice to get in the habit\n\ngit branch -M main (Create new branch main and access it)\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<your_github_username>/example.github.io\ngit push origin main (Push your local main to the new main on Github)\n\nIt may/will prompt your Github username and password\nThere’s been an update to Github where one needs to generate a temporary token (instructions here) to be used as the ‘password’ in the prompt above\nSave your token in a .txt file outside of the repository (otherwise it will invalidate the token, why?)\nCopy and paste the token\nWhen prompted above, input your regular Github username and paste the access token for the password\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Git flow after connecting to remote\n\n\nBig Note - In the future you do not need to repeat Steps 5 and 6 (git branch and git remote add) because those added a new main branch and connecting it to the remote repository already. Once this is done, all you need to do to push your changes to the remote repository are –\n\n\n1. git add * (all files) - Can also select individual files but if you’ve set up your .gitignore properly, this should usually suffice\n\n\n2. git commit -m \"<informative message>\" - Commit changes to be pushed to Github\n\n\n3. git pull origin main (This will fail, why?) - Even though you’re working alone and there won’t be any new changes, it’s good practice to get in the habit of pulling before pushing.\n\n\n4. git push origin main (Push your local main to the new main on Github)\n\n\n\n\nRstudio GUI Git flow after connecting to remote\nIn the future, you can also use te Rstudio GUI to interact with .git/Github. To do so –\n\nClick the ‘git’ tab in the upper right pane (global environment)\nClick on ‘Commit’\n\n‘Rstudio: Review Changes’ window will appear\n\nCheck the ‘Staged’ box for both files\n\nSame as git add *\n\nWrite a commit message in the upper right pane and then click commit\n\nSame as git commit -m \" \"\n\nClick the ‘Pull’ button in the upper right\nClick the ‘Push’ button in the upper right\n\nFollow the directions above to generate a personal access token"

    "section": "Step 4. One YAML to Rule Them All",
    "text": "Step 4. One YAML to Rule Them All\nThe two most important and necessary features of a website are the .yml (directions) and index.qmd (home page). These two files must be in the “home” directory not a subdirectory of example.github.io, most everything else can be organized in subdirectory by page, src, data, etc.\n\nLet’s first inspect _quarto.yml\nBy default, this is what the YAML will look like –\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"example.github.io\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\n\nproject: type: website defines the quarto document/project type to website\ntitle: defines the name of the “Home Button”\nnavbar: defines the navigation bar at the top of the website\n\nleft: on the lefthand side of the navbar\n- href: Add a button/link on our website to this page, document, file, etc.\ntext: Name of the associated -href: button\nformat: html: Please render to .html webside\ntheme: comes from Bootswatch bslib\n\nTo ensure you have the most recent Bootswatch themes type install.packages(\"bslib\") into your console to obtain the most recent stable release from CRAN\nThe Bootswatch theme gallery can be found here\nAn introduction to further thematic customization can be found here\nNote – the above has .rmd examples but the syntax is roughly the same\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s add to _quarto.yml\nRecall that the YAML dictates the aesthetics and structure of the entire website, so anytime we edit the YAML we have to re-render the website to ensure all the pages link together properly, with a consistent theme.\nFor this example, let’s add the following –\n\n#Define the type of quarto project (new from .RMD)\nproject:\n  type: website #Make sure to add `touch .nojekyll` in terminal to supress github jekyll auto \n  output-dir: docs #Need to specify an output directory for Github pages (contains knitted html, pictures, etc.) \n  render: #Specify what files to render (*) means all and (!) means not\n    - \"*.qmd\"\n    - \"*.rmd\"\n    - \"!flexdashboard*\" #This is a type of .rmd/.qmd that needs to be rendered separately due to it's on YAML\n    \n#Defines the main part(s) of the website: navbar, buttons, icons, links, etc.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"<Your Name>\"\n  navbar:\n    type: default\n    left:\n      - text: \"Home\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - text: \"Resume\"\n        href: resume.qmd\n      - text: \"Recent Work\"\n        menu:\n          - text: \"Some Recent Work\"\n            href: some_recent_work.qmd\n    right:\n      - icon: github\n        href: http://github.com/<your_username>/\n      - icon: linkedin\n        href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your_username>/\n      - icon: envelope\n        href: mailto:<your_email>\n        \n#Define output format, .css, and other basic style options\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: lux #Kind of a cool theme & font\n    css: styles.css #Generated automatically, .css allows for more aesthetic control\n    toc: true #Table of contents\n    page-layout: full #This uses the full width of the page\n\n#Execution (warning, message, echo, eval, etc.)\n#Can define global options here like hide all code chunks\n execute:\n   echo: false\n\nWe added quite a few things! Let’s break down by section with a link to additional resources for more granular detail and more options.\n\n1. .yml Scoping Matters\n‘Scoping’ here refers to the horizontal alignment of each line in the .yml. You’ll notice that everything in the yaml has a “nested” structure, in that every sub-option, sub-button, sub-directory, etc. is 1 tab to the right.\n\n\n2. You must have a _quarto.yml and index.qmd in the “home” directory of the website (example.github.io here)\nThese are the only two necessary things for a website to knit/build. It’s worth noting that you can use a mix of .qmd and .rmd reference files with no issues as they’re both handled by knitr on the back end – so feel free to include .rmd files as well.\n\n\n3. project: section\nHere we’ve added - output-dir: <name of folder> to defines the output folder to put all the knitted files & built website into a new /docs folder - This is important because later we’ll need to ask Github Pages to build our website from a particular folder (hint, it’s gonna be /docs!) - Lastly we’ve added render: which tells Quarto which files/folders to render when you click Render Website, and which to not (!) - In general you want knit all .qmd/.rmd files, but for a flexdashboard.rmd type markdown file these need to be rendered separately - Why would some files need to be rendered seperately? If they also have a .yml statement that conflicts with _quarto.yml - More detail can be found here at Quarto Website Options\n\n\n4. website: & navbar: section\nHere we’ve added –\n\n    type: default\n    left:\n      - text: \"Home\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - text: \"Resume\"\n        href: resume.qmd\n      - text: \"Recent Work\"\n        menu:\n          - text: \"Some Recent Work\"\n            href: recent_work/some_recent_work.rmd\n    right:\n      - icon: github\n        href: http://github.com/<your_username>/\n      - icon: linkedin\n        href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your_username>/\n      - icon: envelope\n        href: mailto:<your_email>\n\n\nresume.qmd is referencing a file that we’ve haven’t yet created, but will soon!\nSame with some_recent_work.qmd!\nWe’ve added a right: section to the navbar: with –\n\n3 - icon:’s (Github, Linkedin, Email)\nThat link or href: to your Github, LinkedIn, and Email!\n\nMore in-depth details are discussed in Quarto Website Navigation\nCan also add a sidebar for navigation via the link above\n\n\n\n5. format: html: section\n\nChanged the theme to Bootswatch’s Lux Theme with theme: lux (Gallery, Intro to bslib)\nTold each page to use the full-width of the page via page-layout: full\nYou may want to change the page-layout if you add a sidebar, display a different document, etc.\nA comprehensive directory of all format: html options and usage is given here in Quarto HTML Options"

Originally, adding the geom_path outline of Hennepin county masked all the text labels ‘behind’ that layer and just said “Trace 702” on the side. The Trace numbers correspond to the it’s “order” in the layers of the plot. For example, 1 is the base map (set to “none”). Thus, in order to control the hoverinfo of a particular layer in the plot, you simply need to change that indices hoverinfo to be “none” or “skip”. Weirdly enough, I also believe if you want to change the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) Trace then you need to change the \\((i + 1)^{\\text{th}}\\) layer. Normally I wouldn’t do this in for loop but it’s a lot easier here and there aren’t many iterations.\n\n#Create plotly\nmn_income.ggplotly <- \n  ggplotly(mn_income.ggmap,\n         tooltip = \"text\",\n         height  = 600,\n         width   = 800) %>%\n    style(hoveron = \"fills\")\n\n#Remove a layer's particular hover info (from stack exchange)\n#Trace is 702 based on running the above mn_income.ggplotly\nmn_income.ggplotly$x$data %>% map_chr(\"hoverinfo\") -> hover_chr_vec #To check \n\n#Set replacement indices and values (same length, 702 + 1 = 703)\nindex <- c(3, 703)\nreplacement <- c(\"skip\", \"skip\")\n\n#For loop to replace index and info\nfor (i in 1:length(index)) {\n  mn_income.ggplotly$x$data[[ index[i] ]]$hoverinfo <- replacement[i]\n}\n\n#Display\nmn_income.ggplotly\n\nAnd here is a map of the cities (from Google) for reference –"

You should fetch often (everytime you open the project locally) and pull when appropriate (i.e. when changes are made that don’t conflict with you’re work)\n\n\n4. git pull origin <branch> is usually how you want to engage a pull/merge request\n\nDo not use git pull --rebase until you’ve read this Stack Overflow thread\nIt’s a little tricky, but useful if you find yourself in a situation like the one described in the article\n\n\n\n5. Commit early and often!\nThink of committing changes like saving files. We save files frequently to protect ourselves from the event that the program or your computer crashes and all your hard work is lost.\nSimilarly, we commit early and often so that if and when something goes wrong on our branch or elsewhere, we have a recent version to revert to (see below on how to undo a commit).\n\\(~\\)"

    "text": "UI & Server\nHere, the ui and server are in the same script but that’s because it’s a minimal example for teaching purposes. In practice, these functions are stored in seperate .R files or {r chunks}.\nNote - In practice, to keep more complex workflows tidy and easy to follow we usually write separate .R scripts for different functions or collections of functions (i.e. a package) and load them into our global environment (like a package) with source(my_functions.R)\n\nUser interface (ui.R)\nThis component defines (1) type of interface (fluidPage), (2) structure (panels, layout, etc.), (3) acquires user inputs (sliderInput), (4) displays user outputs (plotOutput). Each is a function with inputs/options like usual.\n\n\nServer (server.R)\nThis component is the source of reactivity – it is a function of input & output, taking inputs from the ui.R and rendering outputs (renderPlot).\nNotes –\nUI\n\nInput object names are given in the inputId = \"bins\" option\n\nMeaning that the object called input stores the input\nWithin that object, a new object bins will exist\nbins is going to store and update the value the user selects from the slider\n\nThus, when selecting bins for the histogram output in the server.R below, it’s called with input$bins\nNo different than a usual list$object\n\nSERVER\n\nIt is a function of input (acquired by ui.R) and a self-referential output (simultaneously created by server.R for ui.R)\n\nInputs are called like above input$bins\n\nNote that output$distPlot <- is base R for mutate\n\nMeans “create or change” the object called distPlot within the list output\nThat change utilizes the input object (reactivity)\n\nIn the ui.R, the function plotOutput renders the plot with the option outputId = \"distPlot\"\n\nMeans use the output$distPlot from the server to render the plot in the user interface.\n\n\nAPP\nThe relationship between the UI and the Server is what induces ‘reactivity’ between the user and the application. It does so by reacting every time a user interacts with the UI by altering the input to ui.R, which induces a call and response from server.R to send new output back to the UI.\nIn plain English, this means it reacts to the user input (ui.R) by re-rendering (server.R) continuously while the app is running.\n\\(~\\)"

This may happen to you as well while you are developing the final product(s) for your final projects. My reccomendations to avoid the slow rendering and unnecessary complications with ggplotly is to simply use leaflet if you’re going to make that type of map – they render almost instantaneously, are very user friendly, and play well with Shiny/dashboards.\nIn that spirit, today we’ll wrap the dashboard above into a regular shiny application (although I think the dashboard is a better tool for this specific communication tool).

You’ll need to check out roxygen2 documentation for the full syntax, but here’s a good example to get you started –\n\n#' @title <Title for data>\n#'\n#' @description <brief description>\n#'\n#' @format <object type, rows, columns, etc.>\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{variable(s) 1}{<describe variable(s) 1>}\n#'   \\item{variable(s) 2}{<describe variable(s) 1>}\n#' }\n#' @source <url to data on your github>\n\"<name of data>\"\n\n\n#' denotes roxygen2 syntax versus a normal comment #\nCan add multiple data to both the /data folder as well as the data.R documentation, just need to leave a blank line in between each roxygen2 doc.\nWill use the same roxygen2 syntax for our functions below"

    "text": "v. Source Code\nHere we find the most important aspect of our package, what the package actually does! As you’ve no doubt noticed by this point, every package in R is really just a collection of functions. Unlike previous work we’ve done, much of which could be accomplished without user defined functions, when building a package everything needs to be wrapped into a funcion with well defined inputs and outputs.\nImportant Note - Do not include library() in your script, this is a big no-no and will cause global availability of functions to change for the user. Instead, use the literal (C++ style) attachment of packages like dplyr::select, stringr::str_to_title, etc.\n\nExample Package Functions\nFor the example package we’re building today, these are the collection of functions which work together to accomplish a larger task (like most packages).\n\n1. Bivariate Normal LM Data Generator\n\nlm_data <- function(n = 10) {\n#Create lm data\n  tibble::tibble(\n    x   = runif(n),\n    x_1 = ifelse(x > 0.5,\n               rnorm(n, 0, 2), #unequal variance\n               rnorm(n, 2, 3)),#implies interaction\n    x_2 = ifelse(x > 0.5, \"Control\", \"Treatment\"),\n    y   = x_1 + rnorm(n, 0, 1)\n  ) |> #base R pipe (new), %>% depends on magrittr\n  dplyr::select(-x)\n}\n\n\n\n2. Fit LM with & without Interaction\n\nfit_lm <- function(lm_data) {\n  #Fit lm from lm_data generator\n  lm.mod <- lm(y ~ x_1 + x_2, data = lm_data)\n  #return lm model object\n  return(lm.mod)\n}\n\nfit_lm_int <- function(lm_data) {\n  #Fit lm from lm_data generator w/ interaction\n  lm.mod <- lm(y ~ x_1 * x_2, data = lm_data)\n  #return lm model object\n  return(lm.mod)\n}\n\n\n\n3. Plot the LM Fit\n\nplot_fit <- function(lm.mod, lm_data, new_data, interaction = FALSE) {\n  #Create string for title of plot\n  string <- ifelse(interaction, \"w/ Interaction\", \"\")\n  r2     <- summary(lm.mod)$adj.r.squared\n  preds  <- predict(lm.mod, new_data)\n  rmse   <- sqrt(mean((lm_data$y - preds)^2))\n\n  #Predict based on new data\n  lm_data |>\n    dplyr::mutate(\n      predicted_val = preds\n    ) |> #Plot it\n    ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = x_1, y = y, colour = x_2)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n    ggplot2::geom_smooth(ggplot2::aes(x = x_1, y = predicted_val),\n                         inherit.aes = FALSE,\n                         method = \"lm\",\n                         colour = \"orange\",\n                         fill   = \"azure2\") +\n    ggplot2::scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#440154FF\", \"#FDE725FF\")) +\n    ggplot2::labs(title = sprintf(\"2 Class Bivariate Normal LM%s (R^2 = %g, RMSE = %g)\",\n                                  string, round(r2, 2), round(rmse, 2))) +\n    ggplot2::theme_minimal()\n}\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nUnlike .RMD’s, these source functions need to be .R files and should generally be in their own .R file (unless there’s a set of functions that are very similar or intimately related). Again, we’ll use roxygen2 to create documentation for each function which can be accessed with ? like usual. More detailed info about documenting data & functions can be found here\nHave no fear, R studio has a convenient way to insert a default roxygen2 skeleton for functions, accessed by Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton –\n\n#' <What the function is>\n#'\n#' @description <describe function's purpose>\n#'\n#' @param input_1 <describe input 1, object type, etc.>\n#' @param input_2 <describe input 2, object type, etc.>\n#'\n#' @return <what object(s) the function returns>\n#' @export #Just tells R to load this function with library()\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' my_function(1, 2) #returns 3\n\nmy_function <- function(input_1, input_2) {\n  addition  <- input_1 + input_2   \n  return(addition)\n}"

If so, refer to Jenny’s book to fix this.\n\n\n\n‘Old’ way via Github & R Studio\nThis way is very similar to the usual way we initialize repo’s on github and then clone them to our local machine.

Here is the wonderful vignette/website and this article explains exactly how dtplyr translates dplyr into data.table commands (via queries).\nIt should be noted that by design, dtplyr is a little slower than data.table because inherently, translation takes a little time.

    "text": "Machine Learning with caret\nSome of you may be familiar with some individual machine learning libraries for particular models (i.e. glmnet for penalized glm’s or randomForest for bagged, random predictor sampled trees). Within the last 10 years though, the caret library has been developed which standardizes syntax and methodology for preprocessing, feature selection, tuning/training via resampling, and variable importance when deploying ML models. I personally use caret all the time, it has an incredibly dense and comprehensive library of different tools for regression and classification.\nAs a package, caret is so useful and widely supported that it actually has it’s own online textbook. If you’re unfamiliar with ML in general, it’s a decent introduction to deploying ML models in practice (but not the statistical/CS theory). StackExchange and StackOverflow are great resources for questions as general as “How do I train a model with caret r” to “what do the parameters in model x describe r”.\nIt should be noted that caret is literally a library, each model you use is pulled off the shelf as it’s own self contained package - meaning that it necessarily depends on the package which contains the model (i.e. glmnet, randomForest, XGBoost, nnet, etc.).\nIt will prompt you to download the required packages if you don’t have them, but if you have a specific question about a models parameters, additional arguments, etc. you’ll need to pass those through the function manually and you’ll need to google for solutions within that model’s package, not caret itself.\nYou can search through all available models in Chapter 6, with comprehensive documentation about training models by tag in Chapter 7 (giving the required package(s) and paramters in a given model). I’d highly recommend finding your desired model(s) with the first link, then using “Ctrl + f” to search through the second link and locate the training info for your model(s).\n\nWhat can caret not do? (Deep learning w/keras)\nUnfortunately, caret was not designed with deep learning in mind (dense, multi-layered, complex neural networks of varying structure and function). Which isn’t a problem because those tools have been widely developed in the Python universe with PyTorch and TensorFlow. Luckily there’s another package called keras (a wrapper for Python deep learning which supports TensorFlow, GPUs, etc.) which allows us to build dense, complex neural networks all within the usual piped syntax from layer to layer.\nHere is the R interface to Keras comprehensive website with tutorials, articles, examples, and references."

Overall, it looks like a very well maintained, functional, flexible framework for building ML workflows with tidyverse principles, structures, and syntax. If you are unfamiliar with caret and tidymodels then I would check out both and see which style you like better. The comprehensive website for tidymodels is found here and this 5 step tutorial is a great introduction to the package.\nHaving used caret for many years and after reading through tidymodels documentation thoroughly, there are definitely a mixture of pro’s and con’s. Here are my key takeaways -\n\nCaret\n\nPros\n\nOver 100+ model types/classes\nWell documented and easy to search through (see book above)\nSyntax for tuning/training with resampling (CV, LOOCV, OOB, etc.) never changes\n\nLittle goofy at first but once you’re familiar it makes sense\nPreprocessing is included\n\nWrapper around underlying package (i.e. glmnet, nnet, XGboost, etc.)\n\nAllows you to pass additional arguments to model (see package documentation)\nAllows you to manually define tuning grids for parameters (base::expand.grid)\n\nNot tidy output, but easy to extract performance metrics over tuning, best tune, params, etc.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nDoesn’t have every ML model class or package but it has a ton of them\nNot tidy, returns list of data.frame’s and other objects as opposed to a tibble w/list columns\n\nRequires a little work translating the base R output into a tibble > ggplot/gt\nHowever, only need to figure it out once, can wrap into function to process output\n\nCan be a little finicky passing parameters through tuning (ex. in RF .mtry vs. mtry due to var masking)\nIs marginally slower due to the caret wrapper than the packages themselves\n\n\n\n\nTidymodels\n\nPros\n\ntidyverse principles and syntax\nBuild models sequentially with recipe, baking, engine, etc. (%>%)\nCan choose the ‘engine’ for a given model\n\ni.e. can choose glmnet or keras to fit a penalized logistic glm (last step)\n\nAllows for very flexible model building & output manipulation\nCan pass results naturally to other tidyverse staples like ggplot2 or gt\nHas built in packages to select ‘reasonable’ tuning grids best on a ‘depth’ argument\nBuilt with statistician’s in mind, has much more natural inferential capability\nHas keras built in so can incorporate deep learning\n\n\n\nCons\n\nUnlike caret, which is an umbrella for individual ML packages, tidymodels also contains a bunch of other non-ML tidy packages like parsnip, recipes, tune, yardstick, rsample, etc.\nEach one, while ‘tidy’, does have it’s own unique syntax unlike any models you’ve fit before in R\nMakes it inherently more complex to learn\nWorkflow is broken up into many steps each with unique functions/packages vs. self contained in 1 cohesive function/syntax in caret\nWhile it has keras wrapped in (TensorFlow backend), I think using keras on it’s ownfor deep learning is just as easy"

We’re going to explore these briefly as a class, so please take the time to do so on your own if you couldn’t make it to class.\n\nKey Takeaways from flextable\nI am a little biased towards gt as it’s newer, similar to ggplot, is tidyverse friendly, and is being rapidly developed to increase it’s functionality. However, flextable has some notable advantages to gt at present and can be more functional in a variety of ways. You’ll never be required to make one in this course, but it may be useful for your final project or in developing Rshiny apps later in the course.\n\nPros\n\nCan knit to .html, .docx, .ppt, and .pdf\nConsistent, relatively easy to follow syntax\nSlightly more customizable than gt\nAppears to work well with Rshiny\nComprehensive, well maintained, established\n\n\n\nCons\n\nNot tidyverse friendly in the same way as gt\nDoesn’t operate like ggplot (while gt does)\nThough gt is much newer (less developed) than flextable, it’s already nearly as functional and I expect that gap to close soon\n\nMinus the ability to create .docx, .pdf, or .ppt\n\nHowever, the ability to create the above documents isn’t that necessary as you can write out any gt as a .jpg or .png and embed it any of those file types easily and reproducibly\n\n\\(~\\) \\(~\\)"

The Social and Decision Analytics (SDAD) lab, strategically located in the D.C. metro area, works “in partnership with communities, academia, government and industry” towards data driven innovations in public policy with “statistical rigor and the creative application of social and decision analytics”.\nWithin the SDAD Lab, The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) program run by Drs. Aaron Schroeder and Gizem Korkmaz offers a unique entrance into the complex world of policy and decision making for human beneficence. My role as a Graduate Fellow in the program has afforded me the opportunity to work in incredibly diverse teams, comprised of everything from Psychologists, Sociologists, and Economists to Healthcare Professionals, Computer Scientists and Statisticians, towards solutions to real world problems faced at the local and federal level. \n\n\n\n\nData Science for the Public Good Symposium\n\n\n\n As a part of my pursuit towards a career in Public Health, a project that I’ve been working on and will continue to work on for my practicum comes from Fairfax County, VA, just across the Potomac from The National Mall. With the county’s sponsorship, we are creating CommunityScapes which “lay a foundation for a quantitative understanding of human health, habitat and well-being”. More specifically, we have been developing an Obesogenic Environment composite index utilizing data from the American Community Survey (Census), Fairfax County, and alternative open sources to quantify and understand the geospatial Social Determinants of Health which contribute to environments conducive to the development of obesity. The ultimate purpose of this index is to generate a robust scale with which the county can assess the temporal effectiveness of their policy initiatives and interventions from a variety of geographic perspectives.\nThe experience has opened my eyes to a unique dimension of public health, in an environment budding with diverse fields of study, people, and ideas, which will influence my contributions to the fields of public health and biostatistics for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend this opportunity to anyone interested in new quantitative methods and applications for improving public health, living in the heart of public policy, Washington D.C."

However, this assessment concerns real world data and real world questions, which means it will inherently be challenging. Don’t worry if you can’t get something to work properly – just do the best you can, document and comment your code so I can give maximum partial credit accordingly.\nMake sure the repository is private\nThis assessment is “open-world” in the sense that you are allowed to use any resource available to you, online or in a text book. However, the work must be your own. This means you must rewrite the code in your own style (like paraphrasing or rewording in a regular paper to avoid plagiarism) and you may not discuss or share materials with anyone else in class. I will be personally grading and reviewing all code and I will be able to tell if code has been copy and pasted from another student or source.\nOther than that, this data is quite interesting, current, and relevant to the state of Global Public Health, so please don’t forget to have a little fun exploring and learning from these data."
