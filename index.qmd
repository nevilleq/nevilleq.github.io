#### Hey y'all -- I'm Q, nice to meet ya!  

<font size = "4"> 
I dabble in Biostatistics, Data Science, and Maths, and am currently a 4$^{\text{th}}$ year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota. Prior, I received a BA from St. Olaf College with Distinction in Mathematics in 2018 and an MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2020. My dissertation work revolves around fMRI brain imaging, hierarchical graphical models for multivariate time-series, and deep learning methods for 'multiview' data (brain imaging + "-omics") with applications in mental health research -- while my current day-to-day biostatistics work concerns interim analyses and conditional power in COVID-related clinical trials.  

With the navbar above you can check out my resume and some current work, presentations, & publications. *I'm an avid `R` user, passionate about data science, and would love to share my technical skills and biostatistics domain knowledge with an industry leader in the healthcare/data science field for an internship Summer '23 | full-time position '24*.

#### About me   

<font size = "4">
In my spare time you're likely to catch me reading whatever new book by my favourite non-fiction author, Leonard Mlodinow, has recently published -- or an older novel from the lesser known Stephen King, a relatively obscure author of mild fiction. I'm also a huge Lord of the Rings fan and have traveled all the way to New Zealand just to have a pint at the Green Dragon in Hobbiton. I love music and still slap some jazz bass & rock'n'roll guitar when the mood strikes. Though I'm getting older, I do still try to stay active and lift a weight or go for a jog when I can. Lastly, and probably most importantly, I am a firm, steadfast, unequivocal believer that hotdogs are sandwiches (sorry if that's a problem).
